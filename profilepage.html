        <h2>Why did I choose this study programme?</h2>
        <p>
          I Chose to Study Information and communication Technology because my
          previous study is in computer science and I have keen interest in this
          field, for me working in this field is my way of being creative, since
          i find it difficult to be creative in general ways such and drawing or
          writing. I believe that learning about communication and Technology
          and its infinite field that's related to everything will be a good
          carrier option too. Furthermore the things that interests me to study
          this programme is that it will enhance my communication and
          technological skills that will lead me towards a good future with
          better opportunities, as I want to be an IT expert working with giants
          and i think that this particular course best fits for that.

          After Graduating i want to work as an IT expert with global companies,
          now a dayâ€™s every company or work is related to communication and
          technology and after graduating from a renounced institute in this
          particular field i want to utilize all my expertise in my carrier. I
          want to play my role in this field and i want to get recognized as a
          professional expert of my field, so i can achieve my goal of becoming
          a part of giants like Google and Apple. In the study i expect to learn
